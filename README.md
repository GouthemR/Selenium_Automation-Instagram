# Selenium Automation for Instagram

In the com.selenium.instagram package I have implemented the code segements to get all the pictures of the instagram profile using the Selenium automation.
In the insta.properties file mentioned in the respository enter your instagram username and password to use this code.
The InstaLoginAndDownload.java is the main file, using that you can run the code.
